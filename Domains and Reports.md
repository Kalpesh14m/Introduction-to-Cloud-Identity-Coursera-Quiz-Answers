|10. Your organization recently purchased some new domains and would like to add them to your Cloud Identity account. Your IT manager isn't sure whether to add your domain as a domain alias or as an additional domain and has asked you to clarify the difference between each. How would you describe the difference between each?|
|=> When you add the domain as a domain alias, each user will have an email address at both your primary domain and domain alias and there is no additional cost per user or group. When you add the domain as an additional domain, each user will have a new Cloud Identity account created for them at the new domain and you'll have to pay for each user account added in the additional domain.|
